# E-commerce-fraud-detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in E-Commerce data. It includes:

  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Outlier detection, categorical analysis, time-based patterns, correlation heatmaps.

  Feature Engineering: Risk flags (high discount, velocity, frequent refunders, shipping anomalies) and fraud risk scoring.

  Data Preprocessing: Scaling, encoding, and class balancing with SMOTE.

  Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Network (Keras).

  Evaluation & Insights: Confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, feature importance, fraud distribution analysis.

  Dashboard: Power BI visualization of fraud patterns by location, payment method, and transaction trends.

The repository contains the notebook, sample dataset, trained models, and Power BI dashboard screenshots, making it a complete fraud detection pipeline for portfolio and learning purposes
